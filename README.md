<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Search engine is a tool which helps users to search  the information they are looking for online using keywords or phrases. Search engines return the results quickly even with millions of websites.

This system suggests the incomplete words while searching with the web pages that the words are present. We named our search engine as Zing Search.</p>
